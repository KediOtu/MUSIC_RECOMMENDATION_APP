# MUSIC_RECOMMENDATION_APP
This project is my graduation project that I did in my last year of computer engineering.

Desktop application with a simple interface. It uses the Spotipy library and Random Forest Regressor from Scikit Learn. It uses MillionSongSubset as its database. The user enters a spotify playlist ID and the program suggests three songs according to this playlist.
In order for the application to work, the API information of the spotify profile that creates the playlist, which ID is entered, must be written into the code.
